	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a function that describes how long an algorithm takes in terms of the quantity of input it receives. Time Complexity, efficient</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> Space complexity is a function that describes how much memory (space) an algorithm requires to the quantity of input to the method. if the array size is n Space Complexity,O(n)</p>
